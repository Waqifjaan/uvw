        <dd>Chicken Karahi, or kadai chicken, is a chicken dish from South Asia. It is noted for its spicy taste and is notable in South Asian cuisine. The dish is prepared in a karahi and can take between 30 and 50 minutes to prepare and cook the dish.</dd>

    <ul><h2>Ingredients Used In Chicken Karahi</h2>
        <li>2kg Chicken</li>
        <li>Fresh Ginger</li>
        <li>Fresh Garlic</li>
        <li>Fresh Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Fresh Green Chilli + Coriander</li>
        <li>Spices</li>
        <li>Cooking oil</li>
    </ul>
    <ol><h2>Method of Cooking Chicken Karahi</h2>
    <li>We start by frying the chicken in a generous amount of oil.</li>
    <li>We than add in a lot of minced ginger and garlic. None of that pre-made, jarred stuff. Fresh ginger and garlic is KEY here. Remember Karahis have a huge emphasis on fragrance and natural flavours. These two ingredients are a major component of that. We want to fry these just enough for the raw smell to go away under no circumstances should you allow this to burn because it will taint the flavour of the Karahi.</li>
    <li>We then go ahead and add all our tomatoes and spices. The tomatoes will release tons of moisture and will break down into a beautifully jammy, thick gravy that will coat the chicken.</li>
    <li>We allow this mix to cook on high, stirring as needed to make sure it does not catch at the bottom of the pan. We do not put the lid on because we are concentrating the flavour. If we put the lid on, we would not get that true Karahi look or flavour because we will be containing the moisture in our pan, not allowing the flavours to concentrate. The result will be a boiled/steamed chicken that looks more like a red chicken shorba and will likely break.</li>
    <li>At about the 15-20 minute mark, the gravy will have thickened nicely, the oil will be separating around the edges, the chicken will be cooked and things will be looking almost done. At this point, you can add the chopped coriander and chillis, turn the heat to low and allow everything to simmer together again without the lid. It can simmer for 5 minutes at this point.</li>
    <li>It is all ready! Now you can garnish with your slices of ginger and serve.</li>

<ol><h2>Method of Cooking Chapli Kabab</h2>
<li>The Chapli Kebab is prepared with raw, marinated mince and the meat can be either beef or lamb/mutton.</li>
<li>The main ingredients include wheat flour, various herbs and spices such as chili powder, coriander leaves, followed by smaller quantities of onions, tomatoes, eggs, ginger, coriander or cumin seeds, green chillies, corn starch, salt and pepper, baking powder and citric juice, like that of lime or lemon.</li>
<li>The kebabs can be fried shallow or deep in vegetable cooking oil over medium heat. Some chefs fry the kebabs in lamb fat over wood-fired stoves to lend an organic flavour. This approach is avoided by some gastronomist, citing health-conscious reasons.</li>
